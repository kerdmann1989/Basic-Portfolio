        <p>Hey there! So, here's a little bit about me: I am a sarcastic, crafty, disney loving,
        mother of four. I have two daughters: Morgan (14) and Madison (17) and two sons: Kyle (26) and Chris (25).
        I also have two grandchildren: Emili (6 mo.) and Charles (3). They are the best.
        </p>

        <p>I have worked for University of Utah Health for 28 years with the past 14 being in Clinical
        Marketing. I've done graphic design, event planning, updated websites, created and executed
        marketing plans and the truth is -- I'M BORED! I'm excited to embark on this coding journey in
        hopes of opening new doors in my career.
